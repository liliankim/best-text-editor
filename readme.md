## Overview
​create a text editor
### The challenge

This week's challenge was to create a text editor using webpack configurations and using the manifest function.

​
### User Story
​
As a user, the user should be able to access a text editor using the command line interface without having an internet connection and be able to use all the data that is stored in the cache.
### Acceptance Criteria
​
-webpack plugins
-service worker
-manifest files



## My process
I firs stareted with calling all the necessary packages and then building the index.js. Afterwards the library was created for each job role and then tests were created and run. Afterwards Cards were written so that the html and javascript could be pulled making a dynamic webpage.
### Built with
​
-webpack
-manifest
-JS
-HTML
​

​
### What I learned
I learned the power of webpacks and manifests, it's really cool to see all of the data being cached. It also helped me apply what we learned to the real world and my everyday life. Whenever I search things on the browser, now I stop to think if that data has been cached.
​
### Continued development
​
TO continue development, I would like to be able to work on using additional webpacks and manifests.
